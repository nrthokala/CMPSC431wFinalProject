The Git Repo has scripts to 
Create Folder - This includes creating NeoFitness schema and all the tables that are required to record User information, their fitness goals and the daily tracking information.
Insert Folder - This includes all the insert statements with the data that goes into each table that was created.
SQL Files Folder - This folder contains .sql files scripts I called from the .bash file. I included the bash file in the Git Repo. Some of the scripts I had to execute for a few options are directly called from the bash file.
