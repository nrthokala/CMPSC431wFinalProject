The NeoFitness Database serves as a comprehensive tool for users looking to manage their fitness and health-related data effectively. Users can interact with the database through various interfaces, including a CLI (Command Line Interface) as well as potentially a web or mobile application.
Registration and Profile Management: Users would typically start by registering themselves within the system, providing essential details such as their name, age, address, and health-related information. Once registered, users can manage their profiles, update personal information, set fitness goals, and track their progress over time.
Tracking Health Metrics: One of the primary use cases of the NeoFitness Database is for users to track their health metrics. This includes recording data such as weight, daily calorie intake, water consumption, exercise routines, and health conditions. By regularly inputting this information into the database, users can gain insights into their overall health status and make informed decisions to improve their well-being.
Goal Setting and Monitoring: Users can set specific fitness goals within the database, such as weight loss, muscle gain, or improving cardiovascular health. The system allows users to monitor their progress towards these goals by tracking relevant metrics and providing visualizations or reports to illustrate their journey. For example, users can track changes in weight over time, monitor calorie intake and expenditure, and analyze the effectiveness of different exercise routines.
Social Networking and Support: The NeoFitness Database also facilitates social networking and support among users. Through features such as user connections, users can connect with friends, family, or fitness buddies to share progress, motivate each other, and participate in challenges or group activities. This fosters a sense of community and accountability, which can be instrumental in maintaining long-term fitness habits.
Nutrition and Recipe Management: Another valuable aspect of the NeoFitness Database is its capability to manage nutrition and recipes. Users can access a database of foods with nutritional information, track their daily food intake, and explore healthy recipes tailored to their dietary preferences and fitness goals. This feature helps users make informed decisions about their diet and ensures they are consuming the right balance of nutrients to support their fitness journey.
Overall, the NeoFitness Database empowers users to take control of their health and fitness by providing a centralized platform to track, analyze, and optimize various aspects of their well-being. Whether it's monitoring progress towards fitness goals, managing health metrics, connecting with others for support, or planning nutritious meals, the database serves as a valuable tool to promote a healthier lifestyle.


The Git Repo has scripts to 
Create Folder - This includes creating NeoFitness schema and all the tables that are required to record User information, their fitness goals and the daily tracking information.
Insert Folder - This includes all the insert statements with the data that goes into each table that was created.
SQL Files Folder - This folder contains .sql files scripts I called from the .bash file. I included the bash file in the Git Repo. Some of the scripts I had to execute for a few options are directly called from the bash file.
